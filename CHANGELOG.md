## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Game review mode** (`src/routes/review/`) — analyse a played game against your repertoire:
  - Paste any PGN; auto-detects deviations, gaps, and opponent surprises
  - Board auto-plays moves from the opening at 500 ms/move with sound, stopping at the first issue
  - Arrow keys and ◀/▶ buttons for manual navigation (cancels auto-play); move sounds on forward steps
  - **DEVIATION** — you played a different move than your repertoire:
    - Red arrow on the wrong move, green arrow on the correct alternative
    - Stockfish evals fetched in the background for both moves (e.g. `(−0.3)` vs `(+0.5)`)
    - "Fail card" drops the FSRS card back to review; "Update repertoire" replaces the move and fails the card
  - **BEYOND_REPERTOIRE** — you played from a position not in your repertoire:
    - "Add my move" saves it; "Engine suggestion" fetches the top engine/book candidate
  - **OPPONENT_SURPRISE** — opponent played a move you haven't prepared for:
    - Phase 1: add the opponent's move to your repertoire
    - Phase 2: add your actual response or an engine-suggested alternative (up to 3 candidates)
  - All issues can be individually resolved or skipped; resolved cards are dimmed
  - Notes field and "Save Review" persists the game to `reviewed_game` with deviation FEN
  - Recent review history shown on the input screen
  - `src/routes/review/+page.server.ts` — load + `analyzeGame` form action
  - `src/lib/pgn/index.ts` — pure `parsePgn` and `analyzeGame` helpers (no DB access)
  - `POST /api/review/fail-card` — marks an FSRS card as Again
  - `POST /api/review/add-move` — adds a move to the repertoire (with optional force-replace)
  - `POST /api/review/save` — saves the reviewed game record

- **Drill session persistence and next-session estimate** — sessions are now saved
  to the `drill_session` table and the end screen shows when the next cards will
  be due:
  - `POST /api/drill/session` — creates a session row on the first card graded
  - `PATCH /api/drill/session/[id]` — finalises the session on completion;
    queries the minimum future `due` timestamp to return as `nextDueAt`
  - End screen now shows a "Next session" stat: "Today at 2:30 PM",
    "Tomorrow at 9:00 AM", "In 3 days", or "—" if no future cards are scheduled
  - Abandoned sessions (navigating away mid-drill) are preserved with
    `completed_at = null` for future dashboard use

- **Hint button in drill mode** — 💡 Hint button appears in the sidebar on your turn:
  - Highlights the source square of the correct piece with a yellow Chessground circle
    (reveals _which_ piece to move, not where it goes)
  - After clicking, the button is replaced by a "hint active" notice warning that
    the move will be graded Again
  - If you then play the correct move: green flash, "Correct! (hint used)" banner,
    auto-graded as Again and auto-advanced after 2 s — no grade buttons appear
  - If you play the wrong move after a hint: same auto-Again flow as always
  - Hint state is fully cleared between cards

- **Keyboard shortcuts in drill mode** — press `1`, `2`, or `3` to grade a card
  (Again / Good / Easy) without reaching for the mouse; keys only fire when the
  grading buttons are visible and are ignored inside input fields
- **Sound feedback** — distinct audio cues for every chess interaction:
  - Piece movement and capture sounds on all interactive board moves (drag-and-drop
    and sidebar clicks) in Build mode, Explorer mode, and Drill mode
  - Auto-played moves in Drill mode also produce sounds as each position is replayed
  - "Correct" notification sound after a right answer in Drill mode
  - "Incorrect" error sound on a wrong answer in Drill mode
  - All four sounds use Lichess's open-source assets (`static/sounds/`)
  - `src/lib/sounds.ts` — centralised sound manager: single `AudioContext`,
    preloaded `AudioBuffer`s for zero-latency playback, module-level enable flag
- **Mute toggle** — 🔊/🔇 button in the Drill mode sidebar silences all sounds for
  the session and persists the preference to the database
- **`PATCH /api/settings`** — new endpoint to update user settings fields; currently
  handles `soundEnabled` and is designed to accept additional fields as the Settings
  page is built in a later step

### Added

- **Drill mode** (`src/routes/drill/`) — spaced repetition practice:
  - Auto-plays the full move sequence from move 1 to the due position at 500 ms per move
  - Board becomes interactive at the due position — user must play the correct move
  - Correct: green flash → Again / Good / Easy FSRS grading buttons
  - Incorrect: red flash → reveals correct move → auto-grades Again after 2 s
  - Progress bar showing current card and total due
  - Session complete screen with cards reviewed and accuracy percentage
  - "All caught up!" screen when no cards are due
  - `POST /api/drill/grade` — applies a rating to an SR card via the FSRS algorithm
  - `src/lib/fsrs.ts` — wraps `ts-fsrs` with DB ↔ FSRS type conversions; exposes
    `gradeCard()` and `nextIntervalLabel()` helpers
  - `drizzle/migrations/0004_learning_steps.sql` — adds `learning_steps` column for
    ts-fsrs v5 compatibility

### Changed

- Removed MAIN / PUNISHMENT move-type distinction — all repertoire moves are now
  treated equally; game review (upcoming) will add off-book moves without tagging
  - `drizzle/migrations/0005_remove_types.sql` drops `type` from `user_move` and
    `user_repertoire_move`, `default_drill_mode` from `user_settings`, and `mode`
    from `drill_session`
  - Sub-mode selector (Main / Punishment / Mixed) removed from drill UI

### Fixed

- Drill page infinite reactive loop on load — `startNextCard()` was reading
  `filteredCards` (a `$derived`) inside the data-sync `$effect` after writing its
  dependencies, causing Svelte 5 to reschedule the effect endlessly; fixed with
  `untrack()`
- "Drill again" button did nothing after session complete — now calls `invalidateAll()`
  so fresh due dates are fetched from the server before restarting

### Added

- **Build mode** (`src/routes/build/`) — interactive repertoire builder:
  - Two-panel layout: 520 px board on the left, move tree sidebar on the right
  - Auto-saves every move immediately; no manual save button needed
  - Turn indicator shows whose move it is (yellow = your turn, blue = opponent's turn)
  - One-move-per-position rule on your turn with conflict warning and board snap-back
  - Opponent positions accept multiple moves (all deviations you want to prepare for)
  - Undo navigates backwards through the current line without deleting saved moves
  - Delete (✕) button removes a move and its entire downstream subtree from the DB
  - Current line breadcrumb is clickable for fast navigation to any prior position
  - Moves-from-position panel shows all saved continuations from the current square
  - FSRS spaced-repetition card created automatically for every user-turn move saved
  - Redirects to dashboard if no repertoire is active
- **Stockfish integration** — engine sidecar + UCI wrapper + candidate move display:
  - `src/lib/stockfish/index.ts` — TCP client that speaks the UCI protocol to the
    Stockfish sidecar; uses MultiPV to fetch top N moves in one analysis pass
  - `POST /api/stockfish` — merges book moves and engine analysis into a single ranked
    candidate list; scores normalised to white's perspective
  - `CandidateMoves` component shows suggested moves in the Build mode sidebar with
    evaluation scores (`+0.45`, `-1.20`, `#3`) and `BOOK` badges for book moves
  - Clicking any candidate plays that move on the board (same path as drag-and-drop)
  - Book/Engine toggle checkboxes let you show or hide each source independently
  - Gracefully degrades when the engine sidecar is not running (book-only mode)
- **ECO opening name display** — shows the recognised opening name as moves are played
  in Build mode:
  - `drizzle/migrations/0003_seed_eco_codes.sql` seeds the `eco_opening` table with
    90 positions covering all major opening families (A00–E97)
  - `src/lib/eco.ts` — server-side helper; queries all FENs in move history in a
    single round-trip and returns the most specific match
  - `POST /api/eco` — authenticated endpoint accepting up to 50 FENs, returns
    `{ code, name }` or `null`
  - `OpeningName` component displays the result as `"B90 · Sicilian Defence, Najdorf
Variation"` with the ECO code highlighted in gold; renders nothing if no match
- **Opening book seed** (`drizzle/migrations/0002_seed_book_moves.sql`) — Alapin
  Sicilian mainline (1.e4 c5 2.c3 d5) as a minimal test dataset; FEN strings
  generated from Chess.js to match runtime FEN output exactly

- **Explorer mode** (`src/routes/explorer/`) — read-only repertoire tree browser:
  - Board arrows show all prepared moves at the current position (green = your moves,
    blue = opponent responses) using Chessground `autoShapes`
  - Gap indicators (`!` badge) on opponent moves that lead to positions with no
    prepared user response
  - Current line breadcrumb with clickable moves for fast position jumping
  - Back / Reset navigation controls; no board interaction — fully read-only
  - "Build from here" button links to Build mode at the exact current position by
    encoding the nav history as a `?line=e4,e5,Nf3` query param; Build mode replays
    the line on first mount so the board jumps straight to that position
  - `autoShapes` prop added to `ChessBoard` component for programmatic arrow/dot
    overlay (available for Drill mode and other future features too)

- **Move annotations** — free-text notes on any saved move in Build mode:
  - ✎ button on each move row in the sidebar opens an edit modal pre-filled with
    any existing note
  - ✎ button in the nav controls annotates the move that led to the current position
    without having to step back first
  - Notes are displayed in italic below the move SAN (truncated to 80 chars)
  - `PATCH /api/moves/[id]` — updates `notes` with auth and ownership checks;
    empty string coerced to `null`; max 500 characters

- **Moves API** (`src/routes/api/moves/`):
  - `GET /api/moves?repertoireId=X` — load all saved moves for a repertoire
  - `POST /api/moves` — save a move; enforces turn rules and creates SR cards
  - `DELETE /api/moves/[id]` — delete a move and cascade-delete its subtree
  - `PATCH /api/moves/[id]` — update the notes annotation on a move

- **ChessBoard component** (`src/lib/components/ChessBoard.svelte`) — interactive
  board powered by Chessground with props for FEN, orientation, movable squares,
  last-move highlight, and check highlight
- **Multiple repertoire management** (`src/lib/components/RepertoireSelector.svelte`):
  - Selector button in the nav bar showing the active repertoire
  - Dropdown to switch between repertoires
  - Modal for create, rename, and delete with inline confirmation
  - Active repertoire persisted in a cookie and validated against the database on
    every request
  - API endpoints: `GET/POST /api/repertoires`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/repertoires/[id]`,
    `POST /api/repertoires/active`
- **Onboarding / empty state screen** (`src/lib/components/OnboardingWelcome.svelte`):
  - Shown on the dashboard when the user has no repertoires
  - Welcomes the user and explains Build mode and Drill mode
  - Inline "Create your first repertoire" form (name + color)
  - Disappears automatically once the first repertoire is created

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-23

Initial project foundation. The app runs end-to-end in Docker but no chess
functionality has been built yet. This release establishes the full technical
foundation that all future features are built on top of.

### Added

- **SvelteKit project scaffold** with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier configured
- **Database schema** using Drizzle ORM with SQLite (`better-sqlite3`):
  - `user` — account credentials
  - `user_settings` — per-user preferences
  - `repertoire` — named opening repertoires (white or black)
  - `user_move` — moves added by the user to a repertoire
  - `user_repertoire_move` — moves with full FSRS spaced repetition state
  - `reviewed_game` — game review history
  - `drill_session` — drill session records
  - `book_position`, `book_move`, `eco_opening` — shared book tables (read-only at runtime)
  - All user tables include `user_id` from day one to support multi-user later
- **Database migrations** run automatically on container startup via Drizzle Kit
- **Default user creation** on first run using `DEFAULT_USERNAME` and
  `DEFAULT_PASSWORD` environment variables
- **Session-based authentication**:
  - Login screen shown to any unauthenticated visitor
  - All routes except `/login` and `/api/health` are protected
  - Session cookie stored in browser
- **Docker Compose** setup with two services:
  - `app` — SvelteKit application (Node.js, port 3000)
  - `stockfish` — Stockfish chess engine sidecar (internal network only, port 3001)
  - SQLite database mounted from host at `./data/db.sqlite` for easy backup
  - Resource limits on the Stockfish container (2 CPUs, 512 MB)
- **Dockerfile** for the SvelteKit app using `@sveltejs/adapter-node`
- **Health check endpoint** at `/api/health`:
  - Returns `{ "status": "ok", "db": "ok" }` when running correctly
  - No authentication required (for monitoring tools)
  - Docker health check configured in `docker-compose.yml`
  - Compatible with Uptime Kuma
